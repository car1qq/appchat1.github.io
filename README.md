<h1>WhatsApp Clone</h1>
This is a super cool WhatsApp Clone that enables 1-1 messaging. Some of the features I really liked-


- streamlined one-step login setup via Firebase that incorporates the users Google Profile picture and info
- server-side rendering, for fast load times
- shows the last time the user was active
- ability to log-out with one click
- all the users and messages are stored within the Firebase database
- built-in loading page 

In building this, I used a lot of different elements, including <b>Next.js, Styled Components, CSS, Material UI, Firebase, Moment, React DOM</b> and more.
